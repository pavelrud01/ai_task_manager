# JTBD Analysis Standards: MySaaS Project

## Overview
This document defines the standards and methodology for conducting Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) analysis specific to the MySaaS project. These standards are designed to ensure consistent, high-quality analysis across all customer research activities.

## Core JTBD Framework

### 1. Job Definition
**A job is a fundamental goal that a customer is trying to accomplish in a given situation.**

**Format:** "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]"

**Example:** "When I'm managing multiple approval workflows, I want to automate routine decisions, so I can focus on strategic decisions that require human judgment."

### 2. Job Hierarchy
- **Functional Jobs:** What the customer is trying to accomplish
- **Emotional Jobs:** How the customer wants to feel
- **Social Jobs:** How the customer wants to be perceived

### 3. Job Context
- **Circumstances:** When and where the job occurs
- **Constraints:** What limits the customer's ability to get the job done
- **Alternatives:** What the customer currently uses or has tried

## Interview Standards
